# Turtle Race Game

This is a simple turtle race game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library.

## Overview

In this game, users can place bets on which turtle they think will win the race. The turtles are represented by different colors, and the user selects a color to bet on. Once the race starts, the turtles move forward randomly, and the first turtle to reach the finish line wins the race.

## How to Play

1. Run the `turtle_race.py` script.
2. Enter the color of the turtle you want to bet on when prompted.
3. Watch the race unfold and see if your turtle wins!
